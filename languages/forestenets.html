            Forest Enets is a language spoken by the Enets people, an indigenous group living in the Taimyr Peninsula in the Russian Arctic. It belongs to the Samoyedic language group, which is part of the Uralic language family. Forest Enets is closely related to Tundra Enets, another language spoken by the Enets people.

            The Enets people traditionally lived a semi-nomadic lifestyle, relying on fishing, hunting, and reindeer herding for subsistence. Their language, Forest Enets, is characterized by its rich vocabulary related to the environment and the activities of their traditional way of life.
            
            However, like many indigenous languages, Forest Enets is endangered due to various factors such as language shift, cultural assimilation, and the impact of dominant languages like Russian. Efforts are being made by linguists, activists, and community members to document and revitalize Forest Enets, ensuring its preservation for future generations and maintaining the cultural identity of the Enets people.</div>
