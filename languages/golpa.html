            Nhangu, also known as Golpa, is an indigenous Australian language spoken by the Nhangu people in the Northern Territory of Australia. It is a member of the Yol≈ãu Matha language family, which is part of the Pama-Nyungan language family, one of the largest language families in Australia.

            Nhangu/Golpa is traditionally spoken in the region around the Gulf of Carpentaria. It is known for its complex verbal morphology and rich cultural significance within the Nhangu community. Like many Indigenous Australian languages, Nhangu faces the threat of endangerment due to historical and ongoing factors such as colonization, cultural assimilation, and the dominance of English.
            
            Efforts are being made by linguists, community members, and cultural organizations to document and revitalize Nhangu/Golpa, ensuring its preservation for future generations. These efforts include language documentation projects, community language programs, and cultural revitalization initiatives aimed at promoting the continued use and transmission of the language within the Nhangu community.</div>
