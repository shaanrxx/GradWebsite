            Kwak'wala, also known as Kwak̓wala or Kwak̓wala, is the language spoken by the Kwakwaka'wakw, an Indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest Coast of North America. The Kwakwaka'wakw traditionally inhabited areas such as Vancouver Island and the adjacent mainland in British Columbia, Canada. Kwak'wala is a part of the Wakashan language family, which also includes other languages like Nuu-chah-nulth and Makah.

Kwak'wala is known for its complex grammar and rich oral traditions, including songs, stories, and ceremonial speeches. The language is highly valued by the Kwakwaka'wakw people as a central aspect of their cultural identity and heritage.

However, like many Indigenous languages, Kwak'wala faces the threat of endangerment due to historical assimilation policies, residential schools, and ongoing pressures from dominant languages such as English.</div>
