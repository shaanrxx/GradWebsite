## Overview
Welcome to the repository for "Echoes of the Silenced," a graduation project aimed at raising awareness about endangered languages through an immersive audio-visual installation. This project combines the use of Blender for 3D visualizations and SoundTrap for audio compositions to create a multi-sensory experience that highlights the cultural and linguistic diversity of endangered languages.
