            Koryak is a language spoken by the Koryak people, an indigenous group inhabiting the northeastern regions of Siberia, primarily in the Kamchatka Krai and Chukotka Autonomous Okrug of Russia. It belongs to the Chukotko-Kamchatkan language family, which is primarily found in the Russian Far East.

            Koryak is notable for its complex grammar and rich oral tradition, which includes folklore, myths, and epic poetry. Historically, it has played a central role in the cultural and social life of the Koryak people, serving as a means of communication and preserving their traditions, knowledge, and worldview.
            
            However, like many indigenous languages, Koryak faces the threat of endangerment due to factors such as language shift, cultural assimilation, and the influence of dominant languages like Russian. </div>
