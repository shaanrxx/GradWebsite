           Yaminahua: The Yaminahua language is spoken by the Yaminahua people, who primarily inhabit the Amazon rainforest regions of Brazil and Peru. It belongs to the Panoan language family, like Sharanahua, and is known for its complex grammatical structure and rich oral tradition. Like many indigenous languages, Yaminahua is endangered due to factors such as cultural assimilation and limited intergenerational transmission. 
          
            Nahua: Nahua is a language spoken by the Nahua peoples, who are indigenous to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Uto-Aztecan language family and is notable for its historical significance, as it was the language of the Aztec Empire and continues to be spoken by various Nahua communities today. Nahua languages are characterized by their intricate symbolism, particularly in artistic and religious contexts. 
     
            Sharanahua: As mentioned earlier, Sharanahua is spoken by the Sharanahua people, who reside in the Amazon rainforest regions of Brazil and Peru. It is a member of the Panoan language family and shares some linguistic similarities with Yaminahua. Like other indigenous languages in the region, Sharanahua faces the threat of endangerment, prompting efforts to preserve and revitalize it through community-led initiatives and linguistic research.
