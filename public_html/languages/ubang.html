            Ubang is a language spoken by the Ubang people, an indigenous community in Nigeria. It is known for its unique linguistic feature called "Ubang verb agreement," where verbs change depending on the gender of the subject. This language is noteworthy for its cultural significance and the intricate relationship it has with the Ubang community's identity and heritage. Like many minority languages, Ubang faces the risk of endangerment due to factors such as urbanization, globalization, and the dominance of larger languages. Efforts are being made by linguists, community leaders, and activists to document and revitalize Ubang, preserving its linguistic diversity and cultural richness for future generations.</div>
